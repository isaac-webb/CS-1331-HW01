I worked on the homework assignment alone, using only course materials. 

Bad 1
-------------------
The error message for this program occurs at compile time:
"Bad1.java:1: error: class BAD1 is public, should be declared in a file named BAD1.java
 public class BAD1 {
        ^
 1 error"

When writing the class for a Java file, the name of the class must exactly match the name of the file, and,
in this case, BAD1 does not match Bad1, causing the error.

Bad 2
-------------------
The error message for this program occurs at run time:
"Exception in thread "main" java.util.IllegalFormatConversionException: d != java.lang.String
         at java.util.Formatter$FormatSpecifier.failConversion(Formatter.java:4302)
         at java.util.Formatter$FormatSpecifier.printInteger(Formatter.java:2793)
         at java.util.Formatter$FormatSpecifier.print(Formatter.java:2747)
         at java.util.Formatter.format(Formatter.java:2520)
         at java.io.PrintStream.format(PrintStream.java:970)
         at java.io.PrintStream.printf(PrintStream.java:871)
         at Bad2.main(Bad2.java:7)"

When using the printf method, the types of the inputs must match the types of the tokens in the format string, and this
program attempts to input three strings where printf is expecting one string and two integers based on the format string.

Bad 3
-------------------
The error message for this program occurs at compile time:
"Bad3.java:8: error: reached end of file while parsing
     }
      ^
 1 error"

All curly braces in Java must be balanced (1 opening, 1 closing), and in this program the author simply forgot to add
another curly brace to end the class declaration after they ended the main method declaration.
