My name is Isaac Webb, and I am a Freshman Electrical Engineering major. Interests include programming and electronics (why I'm here of course!), but also music (I play saxophone and piano for fun), sailing, and "maker" stuff. I am from a small town in Maine called Blue Hill (pop. ~2000), and I love this warm Atlanta winter weather :).
